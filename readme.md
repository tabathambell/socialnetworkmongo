# Social Network API MongoDB

## Description
This challenge is using NoSQL / MongoDB in order to create a social networking back end. This included creating and manipulating users, adding thoughts to the user IDs, as well as reactions to the thoughts. This challenge was interesting and challenging as it was a little more simple than MySQL to the point it threw me for a loop.
