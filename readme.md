# Social Network API MongoDB

## Description
This challenge is using NoSQL / MongoDB in order to create a social networking back end. This included creating and manipulating users, adding thoughts to the user IDs, as well as reactions to the thoughts. This does not have a front-end, so this is primarily used on the Node.js within the terminal. This can be linked into a front end.

## How to Use

In order to use, make sure Node.js is installed. After the source code is installed, run "npm i" to install all necessary npm's in order to make the program run. Once it is completed, go into your terminal and type in "npm start". From there, it should run efficiently. If you have Insomnia Core, use that to see it in action!
